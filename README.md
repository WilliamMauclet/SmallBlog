# SmallBlog
Project to create a small blog with Flask. A previous attempt can be found at https://github.com/WilliamMauclet/CV-Flask.

I would like my blog's looks to be inspired by the following two: 
* https://nicolas.perriault.net/
* https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/

## TECHNOLOGIES
* FLask
* SQLAlchemy (http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/)
* SQLite
* No CSS libraries 
* Responsive design: https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_rwd_viewport.asp (Viewport trick)
* VSCode shortcuts: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf
